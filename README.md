# CP5
This code implements a course registration system that checks if students have viable prerequisites and schedules before allowing them to register for courses. It reads in prerequisite and schedule files, stores the viable prerequisites and schedules in unordered maps, creates a waitlist for courses, and allows students to add themselves to the waitlist, promote their position in the waitlist, and enroll in courses.

The code reads in four command-line arguments: the executable, a file containing prerequisite information, a file containing schedule information, and a file containing waitlist commands.

The main function begins by opening the prerequisite file and reading in each line. For each line, it extracts the Bnum and filename of the student's prerequisites, passes the filename to the pr_check object's pr_reader function, and stores the Bnum and filename in the viablePrereqs unordered map if the prerequisites are viable. It then clears the pr_check object's internal map before moving on to the next line.

After reading the prerequisite file, the code opens the schedule file and reads in each line. For each line, it extracts the Bnum and filename of the student's schedule and checks if the Bnum is present in the viablePrereqs map. If it is, it passes the corresponding filename and the student's schedule filename to the sch_check object's sch_reader function, stores the Bnum in the viableSchedules unordered map if the schedule is viable, and moves on to the next line.

Finally, the code opens the waitlist file and reads in each line. For each line, it uses a stringstream to extract the command and arguments, then performs the appropriate action based on the command. If the command is "newlist," it creates a new MaxHeap object with the specified course name and stores it in the course_map unordered map. If the command is "add," it extracts the Bnum, course name, and points from the arguments, checks if the Bnum is present in the viableSchedules map, and adds the student to the waitlist for the specified course if they are. If the command is "promote," it extracts the Bnum, course name, and points from the arguments, checks if the Bnum is present in the viableSchedules map, and promotes the student in the waitlist for the specified course by the specified number of points if they are. If the command is "enroll," it extracts the course name from the arguments, gets the corresponding MaxHeap object from the course_map, and calls the enroll function to remove the top student from the waitlist and enroll them in the course.
